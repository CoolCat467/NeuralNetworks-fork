class CNN:
    """
    A class to represent a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

    This class provides a customizable architecture for a CNN with
    user-specified layers, activation functions, loss functions, and
    optimization methods. The class includes methods for training the model,
    forward propagation, error computation, and back propagation. The 'layers'
    parameter should be a list of layers in the desired order.

    Attributes:
        layers (list):
            The list of layers in the network.
        activation_fn (str):
            The activation function to be used in the network.
        loss_fn (str):
            The loss function to be used in the network.
        optimizer (str):
            The optimization method to be used in the network.
        weights (dict):
            The weights of the network, initialized during training.
        biases (dict):
            The biases of the network, initialized during training.
        is_trained (bool):
            A flag indicating whether the network has been trained or not.

    Methods:
        train(X, y):
            Initializes the weights and biases and sets the is_trained
            attribute to True.
        forward_propagation(var_x):
            Calculates the output of the network for a given input.
        compute_error(y_true, y_pred):
            Calculates the error of the network's output compared to the
            expected output.
        back_propagation(error):
            Updates the weights and biases of the network based on the
            calculated error.
